                <h3>The journey is on!</h3>
        
                <p>I had amazement to the web pages since my teen age. I love web development
                    because it is a very interactive experience building web sites. You write
                    a line of code and can see the output visually exactly at the moment.
                    No other development gives this lively connection with your code!
                    So I always wanted to build beautiful web experiences with all of
                    my imagination, intelligence with web development knowledge and expertise.
                    Finally the journey has began. I am very much excited to explore the
                    amazing world ahead!
        
                    I always enjoy exploring and learning about more effective and efficient 
                    tools and ways
                    related to my interests. Meet new people and work
                    collaboratively. Respect different opinions and make
                    trustworthy relations through my work and attitude with
                    people.
